Welcome back to our quest to explore the intersection of dynamic programming and motorcycle maintenance! In the previous chapter, we learned about the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and the importance of finding the right balance between practicality and aesthetics. Now, we turn our attention to applying dynamic programming techniques to overcome some of the most challenging and complex problems faced by motorcycle enthusiasts.

We are thrilled to welcome Marc Marquez, the six-time MotoGP World Champion, as our special guest for this chapter. Together, with his expertise and our knowledge of dynamic programming, we will investigate and solve some of the toughest maintenance challenges that bikers often encounter. 

Get ready to rev up and ride with us as we explore the exciting world of motorcycle maintenance powered by dynamic programming!
Sherlock Holmes was stunned to receive a cryptic message from none other than Marc Marquez, the acclaimed MotoGP World Champion. The message read, "My motorcycle engine refuses to shift gears properly, and I know not what to do! Please come assist me, Mr. Holmes!" Intrigued by the challenge, Holmes eagerly accepted Marquez's invitation and set out on a journey to his garage.

When they arrived, Marquez explained that his motorcycle's gearbox was malfunctioning and wouldn't shift gears smoothly as it once did. He had tried everything from cleaning the gears to replacing them, yet the problem persisted. Without a solution, he risked losing his standing in the upcoming world championship race.

Holmes knew that an ordinary approach wouldn't suffice in this situation, and that's where dynamic programming came to play. Using dynamic programming, he devised an algorithm to navigate the gearbox component by component, tracking the optimal solution at each stage.

First, they broke down the problem into smaller subproblems by focusing on the gears individually. Then, they used a recursive formula to find the minimum cost of shifting gears, i.e., the least number of steps necessary to shift the gears and prevent wear and tear. In doing so, they avoided repeating computations and optimized the process of finding the ultimate solution.

The algorithm worked like a charm, and within minutes, Holmes identified and resolved the issue with Marquez's gearbox. By applying dynamic programming and breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, they ensured a quick and efficient resolution to a complex maintenance problem.

With their successful analysis, Marquez was impressed with Holmes's ingenuity and knew he could take on any maintenance challenge that came their way. As they parted ways, Holmes felt a sense of satisfaction and was eager to see what other mysteries they could solve using the art of motorcycle maintenance and the power of dynamic programming.
Sure! In the Sherlock Holmes mystery, the problem of the malfunctioning motorcycle gearbox was resolved using dynamic programming. Here's a breakdown of the code used to solve the problem:

```python
def find_gear_shift_cost(gearbox):
    """
    Finds the minimum cost of shifting gears to prevent wear and tear in the gearbox.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gearbox : list
        A list of gears in the current order.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The minimum cost of shifting gears.
    """
    n = len(gearbox)
    dp = [1] * n

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if gearbox[j] < gearbox[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    return n - max(dp)
```

In this code, the function `find_gear_shift_cost` takes a list `gearbox` that represents the order of gears in the malfunctioning gearbox. The function then applies dynamic programming to compute the minimum cost of shifting gears to prevent wear and tear.

The function uses a dynamic programming approach called the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) to find the optimal solution for the gearbox. The LIS algorithm is designed to find the longest subsequence of elements in an array such that the subsequence is in increasing order.

The code works by creating a list `dp` of size `n`, where `n` is the length of `gearbox`. The `dp` list stores the length of the increasing subsequence of elements in `gearbox` that ends at each index `i`.

The function then iterates over each pair of indices `(i, j)` and checks if `gearbox[j] < gearbox[i]`. If the condition is met, the function sets `dp[i]` to `dp[j] + 1`, which means that the length of the increasing subsequence that ends at `i` is one greater than the length of the increasing subsequence that ends at `j`.

Finally, the function returns `n - max(dp)`, which represents the minimum cost of shifting gears. This value is found by subtracting the length of the longest increasing subsequence from the length of the entire gearbox list.

In solving the Sherlock Holmes mystery, this code was used to optimize the process of finding the ultimate solution for the malfunctioning gearbox, ensuring a quick and efficient resolution to the complex maintenance problem.
